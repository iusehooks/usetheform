# createFormStore
`createFormStore(initialFormState: Object)` creates a read-only form store that holds the state tree of your Form and the hook function to select a "Field" from the Form state.

## Arguments

**`initialFormState`**: object

## Returns

**`[formStore, useFormSelector]`** (`array`)
  An array containing:
  - A read-only `formStore` to attach to your `<Form />` component.
  - A `useFormSelector` hook for selecting specific fields from the form state.

## Basic usage

### 🙈 First: create a form store

```tsx title="awesomeFormStore.tsx"
import { createFormStore } from 'usetheform';

const [formStore, useFormSelector] = createFormStore({ counter: 0 });

export const awesomeFormStore = formStore;
export const useAwesomeFormSelector = useFormSelector;
```

### 🙉 Next: create your awesome Form

```tsx title="AwesomeForm.tsx"
import { Form } from 'usetheform';
import { awesomeFormStore } from './formStore';

export default function AwesomeForm() {
  return (
    <>
      <Form formStore={awesomeFormStore}>
        <Input type="number" name="counter" value="0" placeholder="Counter" />
      </Form>
      <Counter />
    </>
  );
}
```

### 🙊 Finally: bind your components, and that's it!

Use the `useAwesomeFormSelector` hook in any component — no need for context providers. Just select the state you need, and your component will re-render when it changes.

```tsx title="Counter.tsx"
import { useAwesomeFormSelector } from './formStore'

export const Counter = () => {
  const [counter, setCounterValue] = useAwesomeFormSelector((state) => state.counter);
  return (
    <div>
      <span>{counter}</span>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setCounterValue((prev) => ++prev)}>
        Increase Counter
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setCounterValue((prev) => --prev)}>
        Decrease Counter
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setCounterValue(0)}>
        Reset Counter
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `<Counter />` component will re-render on changes.

**IMPORTANT**: You must not select multiple fields in the same call to the selector function. Instead, call the selector separately for each field.

```javascript
// BAD 👎 ❌
const [counter, setCounter] = useFormSelector(state => ({ counter1 : state.counter1, counter2 : state.counter2 }));
```
```javascript
// OK 👍 ✅
const [counter1, setCounter1] = useFormSelector(state => state.counter1);
const [counter2, setCounter2] = useFormSelector(state => state.counter2);
```
